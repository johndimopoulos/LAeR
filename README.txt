The Learning Analytics Enriched Rubric (LA e-Rubric) is an advanced grading method used for criteria-based assessment.
As a rubric, it consists of a set of criteria. For each criterion, several descriptive levels are provided.
A numerical grade is assigned to each of these levels.

An enriched rubric contains some criteria and related grading levels that are associated to data
from the analysis of learnersâ€™ interaction and learning behavior in a Moodle course, such as number of post messages,
times of accessing learning material, assignments grades and so on.

Using learning analytics from log data that concern collaborative interactions,
past grading performance and inquiries of course resources,
the LA e-Rubric can automatically calculate the score of the various levels per criterion.
The total rubric score is calculated as a sum of the scores per each criterion.

This plugin was created by John Dimopoulos <johndimopoulos@sch.gr> as the main part of his Thesis,
for the Postgraduate Program in 'Technology Education & Digital Systems' in the area of e-Learning
in the Digital Systems department of University of Piraeus.

This project was supervised and guided by Dr. Simeon Retalis from the Department of Digital Systems at University of Piraeus,
with the help of Dr. Ourania Petropoulou from the National Technical University of Athens.

The plugin's implementation took place in the CoSyLlab (Computer Supported Learning Engineering) research unit
of University of Piraeus, with the support of Ioannis Arapoglou from ITisART.Ltd.

In order to install this plugin, you should extract all plugin files in your Moodle directory in folder /grade/grading/form/.

Enter your moodle site and login with an admin account.
